# 🍕 CISC 3440: Introduction to Machine Learning

Welcome to **CISC 3440**! This repository is your launchpad into the fascinating world of Machine Learning (ML). Whether you’re a curious beginner or a future data scientist, you’ll find resources, code, and tasty examples (pizza, anyone?) to help you master the basics.

## 📚 What is Machine Learning?
Machine Learning is a branch of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that enables computers to learn from data and make predictions or decisions—without being explicitly programmed. Think of it as teaching a computer to recognize patterns, just like you learned to spot your favorite pizza toppings!

---

## 🚀 Course Highlights
- **Supervised Learning**: Teach machines with labeled data (like showing a pizza and telling it, “This is pepperoni!”).
- **Unsupervised Learning**: Let machines find hidden patterns (like discovering new pizza combos).
- **Model Evaluation**: How do we know if our ML model is a master chef or needs more practice?
- **Real-World Projects**: Apply ML to fun, practical problems.

## 🍕 Example: Pizza Classifier
In `exercise-01/pizza.py`, you’ll find a playful introduction to ML concepts using pizza data. Can a computer learn to tell the difference between a veggie and a meat lover’s pizza? Let’s find out!

## 💡 Why Machine Learning?
- **Solve Real Problems**: From recommending movies to diagnosing diseases.
- **Endless Curiosity**: There’s always something new to learn.
- **Fun with Data**: Who knew math and code could be this delicious?

## 🤖 Let’s Get Learning!
Machine learning is a journey—sometimes cheesy, always rewarding. Dive in, ask questions, and don’t be afraid to make mistakes. (Even the best pizzas need a few tries to get perfect!)
